# Immersive Crafting — TODO / Deferred

Running list of deferred work. See `docs/SPEC.md` for the authoritative design.

## Context detection by tag (ad 2)

Stations are detected by **Tagger tag** instead of hard-coded record ids.

- ✅ Engine: `contextManager` scans `nearby.items` + `nearby.activators` and matches
  each context's `recordIds` entries as record id **or** Tagger tag (`lib.matchesTag`).
- ✅ `CContext.requires`: extra tags that must also be present nearby.
- ✅ Data: `mixing_bowl` → `bowl`; `cooking_pot` → `pot` + `requires: ["fire"]`.

Remaining — the **`fire` tag data** (chose tag-based fire):

- Real cooking fires are mostly **Light (LIGH)** records (campfires, fire pits,
  braziers) plus a few fire **Activators**. Need a **LIGH dump** (like INGR/MISC/ACTI)
  to tag the fire-emitting ones into a `ModTags/ImmersiveCrafting_Fire.yaml`, then
  `cooking_pot` will gate correctly. A few fire activators also exist in the ACTI dump.
- **Verify**: confirm fire objects actually appear in `nearby.items` / `nearby.activators`
  (if fires are Light-type objects not in those lists, the `requires` scan needs to
  cover them too).

## Recipe import gaps (Sun's Dusk → `recipes/sunsdusk.json`)

Imported 25 of 54 SD recipes (`tools`/scratch converter, one tag per ingredient).
Skipped and why:

- **`anyOf` ingredients (22 recipes)** — our ingredient schema is one tag/record per
  slot. Mostly Affa's recipes + Vaermina. To support: extend the ingredient schema to
  accept a list of acceptable ids, or map each `anyOf` set to a single tag.
- **No `Herb` / `Crab` tag (4 recipes)** — SD `herb`×3, `crab`×1. Add the tags (and
  apply them in the ingredient CSV), or map `herb`→`Spice`/`Plant`, `crab`→`Fish`.
- **Default/fallback recipes (3)** — SD `sd_food_def_*` have no matchers (catch-all);
  not expressible here.
- Imported recipes carry **no `cookTime`**; the cooking handler currently does an
  instant commit. Add `cookTime` + a heat/simmer process (Cooking phase) and surface
  it via `ViewModel.progress`.

## Output records

- `world.createObject` needs a **real record id**. SD outputs (`sd_food_*`) only exist
  when Sun's Dusk is loaded. Our hand-made outputs (`SeasonedMeat`, `Stew`) are **not**
  real records — they need real records, or `createRecordDraft`/`createRecord`
  (D1 accepted caveat: custom records are Load-context only, not save-serialised).
